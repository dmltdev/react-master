# @dmltdev/react-hooks

## Motivation

"A little copy is better than a little dependency".

Need a little copy of Tanstack Query but cannot do that due to a variety ofreasons? Install a custom `useQuery` hook with a similar API.

## Installation

Two options:
- Install this as an npm package `npm install @dmltdev/react-hooks` and use it as a regular library
- Install each method separately with `npx install @dmltdev/react-hooks` and use it as a headless library.

The second option may remind you of a @shadcn/ui headless UI library for React.js. You download each component and own it in the codebase. Same design is introduced here: you download the base variant that you can further improve and work on as you wish.
